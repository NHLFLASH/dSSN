# Wallet README

This initial implementation is a pretty simple straightforward representation of a wallet.
The basic wallet interface will allow you to login, create a new wallet or create a new address.
For this first implementation, the keys are simple ssh keys with some modifications.

Also, the address is a modification of the public key for this first implementation.

**The first thing you need to do is Create a new wallet in order to interact with the blockchain.**
